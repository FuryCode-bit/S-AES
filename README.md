# S-AES
A modified version of the well-known symmetric encryption algorithm, AES.

## Work

The work consists on implementing a shuffled version of AES (S-AES), which will be similar to AES
but with an extra 128-bit key (shuffling key, SK)

S-AES will operate as AES, but with two differences:

 * Shuffled Round Keys

 * One Modified Round
